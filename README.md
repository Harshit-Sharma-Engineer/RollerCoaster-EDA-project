# RollerCoaster-EDA-project
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of roller coasters from around the world using Python. The dataset includes various attributes related to each coaster, such as its name, location, operational status, manufacturer, and performance specifications.

Key columns include:

Coaster_Name: The name of the roller coaster.

Location: Where the coaster is located (usually the park or city).

Status: Whether the coaster is currently operating, closed, or under construction.

Manufacturer: The company that built the coaster.

Year_Introduced: The year the coaster was introduced to the public.

Latitude / Longitude: Geographic coordinates of the coaster.

Type_Main: The main type or category of the coaster (e.g., Steel, Wooden, Inverted).

Opening_Date: The official date the ride opened.

Speed_mph: Maximum speed in miles per hour.

Height_ft: Total height in feet.

Inversions: Number of times the coaster goes upside down.

Gforce: Maximum G-force experienced during the ride.

üîç Objectives
Clean and preprocess the dataset.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Visualize trends in coaster features like speed, height, and G-force.

Explore relationships between coaster attributes (e.g., speed vs. height).

Identify Average coaster speed by location, and geographical patterns.
